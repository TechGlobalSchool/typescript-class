# Typescript Class Content

## Introduction
- Developed by Microsoft 2012
- Programming language
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript
- If you want to run TypeScript code in browser or node enviornment we have compile it JavaScript
- There might be a lot of tools to help with compilation (babel, webpack)

- Most common error was type error
- Type error: You expect one type but receive another type (number -> string)
- Compile time -> typescript is helpful
- Runtime
- TypeScript helps to catch type errors in large projects.

## Add type checking to JavaScript code
- In order to type js files with typescript
- Add `allowJs` and `checkJs` to your `compilerOptions` and make both of them `true`


## Basic Types
- Basic types: string, number, boolean, Date, array, object
- Using type `any` is not reccomended unless there is no other way


## Interface
- Fundamental building blocks to create a fully typed application in TypeScript
- Interface can help us to create custom types
- Reusable
- Optional fileds
- Extend Interfaces

## Type alias
- Another way of creating custom types
- Whatever you do in Interfaces you can accomplish with Type alias as well
- We can extends using `&` keyword
- Optional fileds


## Enums
- Enums are one of the few features TypeScript has which is not a type-level extension of JavaScript.
- Enums allow us to use a set of constant values.

## Union Types

## Functions

## Generics
- Provide dynamic and resuable types.

## Challenge
- Follow instructions
